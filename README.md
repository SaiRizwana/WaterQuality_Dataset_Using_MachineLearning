# WaterQuality_Dataset_Using_MachineLearning
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:
- Studied and Analyzed the Water Quality dataset to applying ML models and present my insights. 
- Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
- Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, Decision tree,Random forest,KNN and Boosting.
- Compared the results to recommend the best Classification model.
